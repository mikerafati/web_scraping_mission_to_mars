# web_scraping_mission_to_mars
In this project we build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. Scrape the [NASA Mars News Site](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/) and collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. Assign the text to variables that we can reference later.scrape the latest Mars weather from the Mars weather account (https://twitter.com/marswxreport?lang=en) and scrape the table containing facts about the planet including Diameter, Mass, etc.
Use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.
